% A Lesion Segmentation Tool for SPM
% __________________________________
%
% SALEM-LS (SLS) is a new algorithm designed to segment WM lesions on MRI 
% FLAIR images. This tool requires either the original T1 weighted image 
% or its tissue segmentation. If the T1 weighted images is found as an 
% input, we firstly co-register T1w image to the FLAIR image. Henceforth 
% all the analysis is performed in this space. We segment the tissues on 
% T1w image, and pre-process the FLAIR image (noise reduction, intensity 
% correction and normalization). Afterwards, the WM lesions are segmented 
% as outliers of the GM distribution. Finally the outliers detected are 
% the potential lesion candidates wich will be filtered by lesion size 
% and contextual information (tissue type and neighbourhood tissue type). 
% Another restriction can be applied consisting of avoiding elongated 
% regions attached to the ventricles. The outlier detection is performed 
% in two steps, firstly we obtain the bigger lesions allowing the more 
% permissive filter. In the second step we apply these filters more 
% conservatively while looking for small lesions. All those parameters can 
% be tunned in order to get a better accuracy, although a set of default 
% values is given.
